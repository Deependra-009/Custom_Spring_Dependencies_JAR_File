# Custom Spring Dependencies Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Custom Spring Dependencies Repository! This repository serves as a centralized location for custom Spring dependencies in the form of JAR files that are not available in the official Maven or Gradle repositories. If you find yourself in need of specific Spring libraries or modules that are not readily available through standard channels, this repository can be a valuable resource.

## Dependencies
<ul>
  <li>E-commerce Service Dependency</li>
  <li>TrustShield</li>
  
</ul>

## Getting Started

To use the Custom Spring Dependencies Repository in your project, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the required JAR files from the repository's [JARs](JARs/) directory.

2. Manually add the JAR files to your project's classpath.

## Usage

Once you've downloaded the necessary JAR files, include them in your project by placing them in the appropriate directory and configuring your build tool accordingly.

### Example (Manual Classpath)

1. Copy the downloaded JAR files to your project's `lib` directory.

2. Update your project's classpath to include the JAR files. This can be done in your IDE or by modifying your build script.

### Example (Maven/Gradle)

Since this repository provides JAR files directly, you can manually download the JARs and place them in a specific directory within your project. After that, configure your build tool to include these JARs in the build.
